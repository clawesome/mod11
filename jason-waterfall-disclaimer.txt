My name is JASON FUCKING WATER FALL. I'm not subject to an NDA or any kind of equivalent gag order regarding issues within GME's milieu. I haven't received any information indicating an unreconciled number of votes cast in GameStop's 6/9 shareholder election exceeded the number of outstanding shares. I also haven't received any information indicating that the number of beneficial shareholders exceeds the number of outstanding shares. I once touched Owen Hart's sweaty bicep as he walked out with Jim Neidhart at a house show. I have never met or knowingly spoken to Ryan Cohen, Deep Fucking Value, Ken Griffin, Vlad Tenev, Steven Cohen, Maxine Waters, Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, PFTCommenter, or Ariana Grande.
